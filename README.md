# py_percolation

Percolation refers to the movement and filtering of fluids though porous materials.
Therefore, it refers to the movement of particules through a lattice.


## A long time ago
I simulated percolating systems in matlab as a physics students.
I now want to give it a try in Python, with a bit more structure.

## What's a percolating system?
A percolating system is defined by a lattice, meaning a repeating arrangement of points.
Each point has a form that defines its neighbors.


## What can we study with percolating systems?
- If each point has a probability p of being "filled", for a given lattice topology, what is the probability that the system is percolating (meaning that there exists a continuous path across the lattice).
- How can we establish if there is a percolating path in a system?
- How does changing the lattice toopology affects all of this?
- What if there is obstacles that prohibite percolation?
